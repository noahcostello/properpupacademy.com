    "introCopy": "<p>I am a well-rounded certified dog trainer who has worked with breeds of all ages and sizes. I'm located in Huntington Beach (Orange County), California.</p><p>At a young age, I strived to educate myself about animals. I enlisted in many programs and volunteered at various animal shelters, contributing time to help decrease the number of homeless dogs.</p><aside><blockquote><p>My passion is training dogs to live in harmony with people</p></blockquote></aside><p>I've always surrounded myself with love from a range of animals in my household, especially dogs. My recent companion is a rescue dog that goes by the name of Monty. Monty is a shy Border Collie mix. He was most likely neglected as a puppy.  I worked with Monty to overcome his fears and trained him to be a well-behaved member of society.  This process not only helped realize my passion to help other dogs, but it gave me firsthand experience as to what many people go through.</p><p>My ability to keep calm in turbulent environments enables me to handle, train, and manage dogs with different demeanors. My passion is training dogs to live in harmony with people and to educate the public on how rewarding a canine in your household will be – with a little work and a lot of love!</p><p>Contact me to get started: <a href='mailto:katelyn@properpupacademy.com; rel=;noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>katelyn@properpupacademy.com</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href='tel:17142516864'>1-714-251-6864</a></p>"

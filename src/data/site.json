    "introCopy": "<p>I am a well-rounded certified dog trainer who has worked with  various breeds, of all ages, and sizes. I'm located in Huntington Beach (Orange County), California.</p><p>At a young age, I strived to educate myself about animals, by enlisting in many programs and volunteering at various animal shelters, contributing with helping decrease the number of homeless dogs.</p><aside><blockquote><p>My passion is training dogs to live in harmony with people</p></blockquote></aside><p>I've always surrounded myself with the love of a range of animals in my household, especially dogs. My recent companion is a rescue dog that goes by the name of Monty. Monty was a shy Border Collie mix, who was most likely neglected as a puppy.  Working with Monty to overcome his fears and training him to be a well-behaved member of society has not only helped fulfill my passion to help other dogs, but given me firsthand experience as to what many people go through.</p><p>My ability to keep calm in turbulent environments enables me to handle, train, and manage dogs with different demeanors. My passion is training dogs to live in harmony with people, and to educate the public on how rewarding a canine in your household will be, with a little work and a lot of love!</p><p>Contact me to get started: <a href='mailto:katelyn@properpupacademy.com; rel=;noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>katelyn@properpupacademy.com</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href='tel:17142516864'>1-714-251-6864</a></p>"
